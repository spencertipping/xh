UNIX philosophy.
I'm increasingly convinced that the monolithic design is wrong, or at the very
least suboptimal. Here's why.

The UNIX philosophy ends up being a really valuable thing to have, especially
when it comes to command-line applications. In particular, it guarantees you
the ability to switch out individual components factored (mostly) by
functionality; otherwise you'd have a lot of reimplementation and poor
factoring.

Unfortunately, xh lives at the wrong end of this spectrum right now. The
problem isn't intrinsic, but rather a by-product of the way I've been doing the
design. As part of lining up tons of different use cases, I've been implicitly
committing their solutions to xh and not being particularly careful to factor
xh-as-a-facilitator from xh-as-the-solution. These two things are very
different.

For example, xh needs to help me manage a bunch of computers' volumes as a
single distributed filesystem. But it doesn't need to actually move files
around, nor does it need to forward them for me. These jobs can be outsourced
to scripts that create and destroy named FIFOs or directory trees of links.
There shouldn't be a strongly compelling reason to write them as xh libraries,
either; they should be mostly standalone systems whose only ties to xh are
user-interface-related.

In other words, xh forces a strange dichotomy: do we implement something as a
standalone script of some kind, or do we tie it into the distributed xh runtime
and do it with POSIX calls? xh libraries need to be written in such a way that
standalone execution makes sense.

Library bindings.
I think it's fine for xh libraries to always assume that they can see an xh
runtime; otherwise there's arguably little point to writing them in the first
place. The important thing is that they also need to be usable in a standalone
context, even if they weren't written with this in mind. This can be managed by
the automatically-created xh runtime instance.

In this sense, xh is really more of a distributed variable binding context than
anything else:

| 1. The shell is a specific library that uses distributed variables.
  2. Execution semantics are another library, used by the shell and elsewhere.
  3. Self-replication is a wrapper that happens to contain the xh runtime code.

This should simplify the architecture considerably. So now the design looks
something like this:

| xh runtime
     \ \ \ \-- library definition library (with CLI generator)
      \ \ \--- execution semantics --- repl
       \ \---- self-replication ------ user configuration
        \----- ssh/file accessors ---- map/reduce library

If the goal is to write an interactive application, you should end up with a
library. In other words, xh should handle the interaction well enough to let
you just focus on what you're writing, not how to make it CLI-accessible.

Arguably, then, everything should depend in some part on the execution
semantics; this is what gives you transparent distributivity. It should make
sense to write libraries in xh-script rather than in Perl, which probably means
that we need at least:

| 1. Perl passthroughs, or at the very least a complete POSIX interface.
  2. A comparably flexible execution model.
  3. Fast and powerful data structures.
  4. Multimethods. This is both crucial and difficult.

We need multimethods because we need to support arbitrary argument syntax
extension, in particular for file delegates. For example, it should be possible
to pass an HTTP stream to any program as a file (proxied via FIFO):

| xh$ head -n10 http://google.com
  ...
  xh$

XH also needs a fairly deep understanding of what's going on; if an argument
has machine-affinity, we should localize the program's execution to that
machine if possible.

Runtime architecture.
The runtime is just a context that contains global variables, each of whose
values is immutable (but the bindings themselves can be changed atomically).
Some of these variables refer to machine-local values; for instance, the
standard output of PID 498 on machine "foo". In cases like this, the runtime
needs to make the stream accessible across machines (and probably create the
stream IDs too).

Streams are different from other values because they are implicitly mutable
(since their state is destructively changed when we read from or write to
them). It's probably worth having a dedicated API to deal with this elegantly.
Actually, it may also be worth defining a distributed POSIX-style layer to do
things like kill processes on remote machines; the real goal here is to
eliminate machine locality concerns when scripting things. It shouldn't be hard
to do this, since it should just be a multimethod case for POSIX functions. I
guess this obligates xh to provide fast multimethods, at least when the types
are predictable.

Execution semantics.
This layer does two things. First, it makes library calls to the xh runtime to
bind, read, and manipulate values; and second, it creates a context for local
mutable values (including a call stack, which isn't modeled by the xh runtime).
I think local mutable values will be invisible to the runtime, but you can
export them by freezing them into immutable forms, just like Clojure's
transient -> persistent transition. The execution layer needs to implement
these transient data structures.

At the moment the runtime is in an awkward place of providing half of the data
structures (immutable) and knowing nothing about the other half. I'm not sure
whether this is a problem, but it seems like it could be. The runtime already
needs to understand some things about the data it proxies, so maybe it's only
natural for it to provide some standard APIs. I think the problems start
arising when we want to do creative stuff with parsers and memory spaces; for
example, who's responsible for governing the state of a lazily-realized global
value that is parsed from a FIFO? Is this value legitimately immutable?

Ok, let's do this. Individual machine instances can expose multimethod-based
APIs through the runtime; the result is that you can call functions against
opaque values. This makes some sense anyway, since lazy values aren't
definitionally immutable.

This is nice. So the runtime manages two kinds of values: machine-local ones
(which require forwarding of some kind), and constants that don't have machine
affinity. Importantly, though, the runtime doesn't have any execution
semantics, at least not initially. I'm not sure whether it makes sense to have
the runtime be extensible this way.
