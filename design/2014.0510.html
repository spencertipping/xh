Architecture.
I think it's ok to have xh be Perl-hosted, not self-hosted, at least initially.
It's a lot of work to write a self-hosting compiler, and it isn't clear that we
need that kind of performance just yet. With that in mind, xh has the following
base-layer components implemented in Perl:

| 1. Image management layer; this is some bootstrap Perl code to set up an
     internal key/value store.
  2. xh-script base data structures.
  3. Parser reducer -> Perl compiler.
  4. xh-script text -> parse-tree reducers.
  5. xh-script parse-tree -> Perl code reducers.
  6. xh runtime bindings, e.g. heap, definition table, gc, thread scheduler,
     etc.

On top of that, the following are written in xh-script:

| 1. Later on: self-hosting xh-script compiler
  2. REPL interface
  3. Virtual filesystem support
  4. JSON, HTTP, SSH, etc, protocol support
  5. Distributed computing library

Focusing the design.
Right now xh is being designed as this really advanced FP Lisp with all kinds
of cool features. Which is great, but simplicity really needs to enter the
picture somewhere. Homoiconicity should be the mechanism by which a user can
opt into complexity, but it shouldn't force this on people. At the very least,
we need a very minimalistic set of execution semantics, since a common use case
will be to write a library that distributes or otherwise changes its
implementation.

So let's start with a really simple imperative execution model. It's fine to
assume a few things like value-immutability as long as something is mutable
(tail recursion and file contents, for instance). We don't need anything beyond
basic control flow; exceptions, continuations, etc are all unnecessary (and, in
fact, conflict somewhat with the way shells tend to work).

What about some kind of concatenative syntax? This makes it a lot easier to
think of parsers as folds and/or reductions over input, which is well-suited to
the line-editing model. There are also some good technical reasons to use
reducers as a model for data consumption; it should be possible to compile them
down to really fast C or Perl code, for instance.

Data access, whether it's from files, sockets, etc, should have a rich enough
API that we can find a fast solution. For example, if you need the
100-millionth byte from some file, it should be a seek rather than a reduction.
On the other hand, you might want to reduce over a directory tree.

Reductions can be converted to micro-queues using spring-loaded allocation.
Just having something to manage this kind of caching would be very useful.

Things I'd like my shell to do better.
Just planning this out from a top-down perspective (again).

| 1. File management. Should make it way easier to manage tempfiles,
     deduplication, etc. A shell should manage _data_, not _files_. It should
     never ask where you want to store something, and all data that isn't
     opaque should be content-addressible.
  2. Data integration. Should be able to talk to anything and inspect any file,
     getting data in a common format.
  3. Distributed computing. I shouldn't notice the fact that I'm doing
     something on a different machine, and remote files should act completely
     local.
  4. Completion of various sorts. For example, if I try to run a program I
     don't have, it should offer to install the right package. It should
     remember long filenames, strings, sequences of options, etc. It should
     predict things based on where I am and what I've typed so far.
  5. Configuration management. My shell, including configuration, needs to be
     one file I can download and run anywhere.
  6. Programming. Ideally I'd never leave my shell to get most scripting jobs
     done. Should have full access to POSIX.
  7. Statistics. This will be increasingly useful to sysops as statistical
     problems become more commonplace.

File management.
Every piece of data anywhere, including terminal input and program output,
should be accessible in a file. Files should be content-addressible, for
instance "what came after the regexp X?". I should be able to cat stuff to the
terminal as a way to store things.

Files should be mobile between machines, and xh should fully track this. I
should be able to "tag" files with various labels.

XH should never cause the disk to fill up. It should figure out what to store,
possibly with hints from the user, and delete things on-demand. The most
important stuff should be stored back into the xh image so I can get to it
after downloading xh over the internet.

Data integration.
xh should be able to parse JSON, XML, CSV, TSV, and HTML. It should be able to
open sockets and HTTP connections, and apply custom parsers to streams. It
needs to have a reasonable set of data structures, possibly extensible, to
represent intermediate results.

Distributed computing.
xh should maintain a list of servers I have ssh access to, and should connect
to them automatically. I should be able to construct wildcards that refer to
files on different machines, and xh should transparently localize program
execution to the files being accessed.

There should be a few different mechanisms for data access:

| 1. Run the program on the remote system, forwarding stdin, stdout, and stderr
     (default).
  2. Run the program locally, streaming file data sequentially using a fifo.
  3. Run the program locally, transferring all of the file data into a
     temporary using rsync or similar. The temporary is then subject to GC.

Completion.
Every keystroke matters. xh should spend a lot of effort trying to figure out
what I'm about to do next, or how to make my life easier. It should know things
such as:

| 1. How to install any program I might want to run, ideally by looking through
     command-not-found-data.
  2. The likelihood that I'll refer to any given file at any moment.
  3. The likelihood that I'll cd somewhere at any moment.
  4. The options I'm likely to use with a program.
  5. The environment variables I'm likely to define.

Its job is to minimize the amount of effort associated with any action it can
predict; in other words, it should compress keystrokes in a mnemonically
sensible way.

An invariant across all completion features is that it can never cause
perceptible delays. All completion must be fully nonblocking, and because
keystrokes are being compressed the results must be identical with or without
any delay reading the data. Compression should be aware of the following
variables:

| 1. The number of keystrokes saved per alias (aliases create cognitive
     overhead).
  2. The typing effort involved (xh can figure this out based on profiling
     keystroke timing and use of backspace to fix errors).

In addition to completion, xh should give me transparent previews. For example,
if I'm editing a pipeline I should be able to see the data at any given moment.
I should also be able to preview any file, HTTP destination, stdout stream, or
other data source _nondestructively_; that is, previewing it doesn't require me
to then reinitialize the data source to get the full stream. This means xh
needs to cache whatever content has been previewed and be able to replay it.

Configuration.
All personal information like keystroke compression tables, frequently-used
directories, etc, should be stored in the xh image for later use. This data
shouldn't require any manual maintenance.

Programming.
xh-script should be powerful enough to do things like writing nonblocking
webservers, parsing files, mixing data from various sources, writing and
kicking off distributed computing jobs, etc. It should make sysadmin stuff
especially easy, but it also needs to be both abstractable and fast. For
example, I might want to build a height map of all buildings in Los Angeles
given a bunch of lat/lng, ground elevation, and suite numbers, then export as
CSV. Or maybe simulate traffic patterns, or optimize a statistical model.

Any script I type on the command line must be stored and indexed. Definitions
should be indexed by name and fully versioned so I can see how something
changed. I should be able to preview any function call and inspect data flowing
through a program. Debugging data should be saved as an auxiliary stream, and
like program output should be content-addressible and culled by anticipated
importance.

I should be able to transparently access resources on other systems, and pass
things around easily. It's ok for resources to be anchored to specific
machines; this will happen if I want to refer to the stdout of a running
process or something. xh should transparently forward this wherever I need it.

XH should implement its own heap allocation that uses a nonblocking disk swap
strategy. No program should cause thrashing, and programs should support
hundreds or thousands of virtual threads. Execution semantics should be
identical regardless of a program's physical location.

Data structures should be an algebraic abstraction, not a statement of
implementation. For example, I should be able to use a MySQL database as either
a list or an associative map. The internet could be a lazy map from URLs to
parsed HTML documents. The filesystem could be a lazy map from name to
contents. It should be easy to assert these interpretations.

Finally, the language should be homoiconic. It's just no fun otherwise.

Statistics.
This should be a library, but it should probably ship with the core. XH should
use it internally for autocomplete prediction and other statistical problems.
No idea what the API should look like.
