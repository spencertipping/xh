Degrees of plurality.
xh is in a difficult place because its syntax needs to be more streamlined than
that of Lisp. Nobody in their right mind is going to wrap every statement they
write with (), and if () aren't required on the command line, then nobody will
remember to do it in shell scripts. (Beyond which, it's just silly; having just
words at the toplevel should be fine since the rest of the world has moved to
line-delimited statements anyway.)

So let's take this at face value for a moment. We need to have two list axes,
one for lines and one for words. This is useful anyway, since it makes it easy
to write things like matrices. But beyond that, brace-lists of lines already
have meaning as functions; vectors and paren-lists don't have this meaning.
This is great because braced lists can be used to encode multiple solutions to
a function inversion, an encoding that, combined with sufficiently lazy
evaluation, provides both breadth-first searching and alternative
continuations. (So we're implying that call/cc exists in some form, though
there is no way we want to make this as general as it is in Scheme.)

Quick summary of semantics:

| $ nth [foo bar bif] 0
  foo
  $ def foo {
  >   echo hi
  >   echo there
  > }
  $ nth $foo 0
  [echo hi]
  $ count $foo
  2
  $ nth (nth $foo 0) 0
  echo
  $ def echo-1 (nth $foo 0)
  $ def echo-2 (nth $foo 1)
  $ def new-foo {$echo-1 $echo-2}
  $ count $new-foo
  2
  $ == $new-foo $foo
  1
  $

Oh crap. This is a problem. We can't have xh infer a newline in the middle of a
{} because that would violate the contract that list construction is a form of
string concatenation. I think we have a major issue here.

Possible workarounds.
Suppose that {} interpolates without special cases. Then we probably use some
kind of list function to get the statements from a {}, rather than
destructuring against it directly; maybe two functions called "bl" and "lb" for
"block->list" and "list->block":

| $ def foo {
  >   echo hi
  >   echo there
  > }
  $ def (functions-called-by (lb $fn)) {
  >   map (nth $_ 0) $fn
  > }
  $ functions-called-by $foo
  [echo echo]
  $ def (fn-replace (lb $fn-list) $find $rep) {
  >   lb (map {[$find] $rep
               [$x]    $x}   $fn-list)
  > }
  $

Do we really even want lines to mean what they do here? It seems out of place.
I think it makes sense on the command line, but as lambda-alternatives it just
seems weird given that we're writing Lisp.

meta::note('line-splitting', <<'__');
Line splitting as a language feature.
A lot of languages use line splitting to delimit statements, which seems
appropriate if you think of each imperative thing as being a
"programmer-thought transaction"; that is, you commit to a state transition and
then move on. So vertical space becomes a progression where moving downwards
means you're defining more stuff, or at least moving forward in
state-transition space.

So in a sense, and somewhat counterintuitively, one could argue that the REPL
itself demands a certain degree of imperativeness from your language, since the
user is committing to statements independently and the ways in which these
statements are connected have to do with sharing a surrounding context --
usually imperative state of some sort (or at least definitions, which are
arguably stateful in their own way).

It's worth being careful here. We can't/shouldn't divorce notations too
heavily; if the REPL really is imperative (as it generally is in a shell), then
the language should also be somewhat imperative. Therefore, we need a shell
language that is not, in fact, imperative at all.

How about this, then? Newlines aren't special except as REPL statement
terminators. All toplevel statements are paren-wrapped, but the repl gives you
a UI around the language by assuming you're going to call a function. It
implicitly opens a paren for you, and closes that paren when you type a newline
(unless you're in a sublist or something). I think this wouldn't be
particularly confusing if the prompt made it obvious:

| $ xh
  (                             <- initial state
  (ls                           <- after typing 'ls'
  (ls)                          <- after hitting enter
  bin dev etc ...
  (

Ok, that looks reasonable. Let's run with it until something breaks horribly.
