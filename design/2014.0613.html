Architecture.
I wrote up a quick design for a network protocol; in doing this I started to
realize a few things:

| 1. I'd really like to use xh to do this. It would help a lot with the
     CPS-conversion, provided my compiler can handle it. (Or at the very least,
     use microthreads.)
  2. xh is a data format, not a code format. It should be some kind of
     canonical form for code, and it should include an abstract evaluator to
     get the data (i.e. intent via invariants) from it.
  3. The original idea of having a bootstrap xh->perl compiler is basically
     right. We want as much as possible to be written in xh because it gives us
     the ability to recompile to other targets.

Point (3) is especially important because not every target will have a working
Perl interpreter/library. In those cases we may need to compile via C or some
such.

Blocking models.
xh-script isn't host-threaded; it uses virtual threads and soft internal
blocking to manage concurrency. This means we can pretend to make a blocking
call, and this will just transfer control to another thread if we get
EWOULDBLOCK.

Rewriting-based evaluation.
Suppose we commit to the abstract rewriting model in 2013.0308.html. How many
decisions does this force?

| 1. All data structures must be representable as strings.
  2. Therefore, all data structures are immutable (at least metaphorically).
  3. Most semantics are defined in terms of the quoted forms of things.
  4. Lazy semantics come for free, as do fully-traceable errors.
  5. Macros come for free, mostly.
  6. No "force evaluation on this argument" stuff for functions.
  7. Trivial evaluation priorities, which is really useful for IO scheduling in
     distributed workflows.

None of these are dealbreakers, and in fact most are useful. (1) and (2) help
since our runtime is distributed and we want to minimize coordination overhead.
Rewriting also produces really straightforward semantics, which is great
because the compiler can then experiment with optimization strategies and
verify the results against its known spec. The associativity of the rewriter
also means that the compiler has a good sense of what can be parallelized.

Some disadvantages:

| 1. If data structures are strings, it's tempting to implement some kind of
     massive destructuring-bind facility; but it's still complicated and a
     potential disaster. We just can't do this in the core language because the
     limit case is some kind of implied parser combinator library.
  2. Need to be really careful about the syntax. Data structures can have
     string forms without the language treating them as strings; we don't want
     a bunch of untyped data flying around. (This is why we have typeful quoted
     forms for things.)

Semantics.
Ok, let's actually define the semantics of this language to see how well it
would work. The only scope is a global binding table, and 'def' is a builtin
function that binds one or more values. Syntax-wise we have this:

| foo 15 1.0e-10                <- unquoted string literals
  "foo bar" 'foo bar' \$foo     <- quoted string literals
  (1 2 3)                       <- list literal
  [1 2 3]                       <- array literal
  {1 2 3 4}                     <- map literal

Any literal can be tagged:

| fn(1 2 3)                     <- list literal tagged as "fn"
  point[x y]                    <- array literal tagged as "point"
  r"foo"                        <- string literal tagged as "r" (for regex)

That's about it for the syntax. Maps don't always need an even number of forms
like they do in Clojure; if you have an odd number, the last binding maps to
the empty string or something. Functions are defined by tagging either a list
or a map with "fn":

| def say-hi fn(echo hi)
  def say-hi fn{[]      (echo hi)
                [$name] (echo hi there, $name)}

I guess it's ok for the evaluator to treat these forms specially? Need to think
about how it knows to do this. Can the user define more fn() equivalents?

The unescaped newline and the semicolon are each list terminators. If the
parser is streaming (which it should be), then this is not a problem; there's
no defined "arity" for a read operation, so processing a stream of "here's a
new value" requests shouldn't be too hard. (Maybe think this through some
more.)

| fn(echo hi)                   <- structure needs to be ((echo hi))
  fn(echo hi; echo there)       <- structure is ((echo hi) (echo there))

Strange and unfortunate. It means newlines are significant all over the place,
which probably isn't what we want. I really need to figure this out.

In a sense it's checkmate: either whitespace matters (traditional), or it
doesn't (Lisp), and xh wants both in a context-dependent way. That isn't going
to work. We can't defer parsing like that.

So let's do this. The whole point of newlines-as-statement-terminators is to
make it easy to use the repl. That can be a hack that lets the user enter
commands, just like a Lisp repl (but I guess multi-reading until we see the
unescaped newline).

Semantically significant type tags.
We need to have a way to express at least the following:

| 1. Anonymous functions: fn(echo hi)
  2. Sets (data structure): s[x y z]
  3. Regular expressions: r"foo"

In general, we should encode as much as possible using type tags; numeric
quantities, for example, can be unit-quantified:

| + 5.km 10.ft                  <- I guess we have unit conversions somewhere

Type tags suffer from the problem that they're just words; it would be nice to
support more complex forms. Complex dimensional quantities, for example:

| 9.8.[m s.-2]

And the syntax sucks. Maybe worth taking a page from Clojure and treating these
things as metadata? So values have sets of metadata values. What could go
wrong?

| 9.8 ^[m s-2]

Metadata should follow, not precede, values; we want to front-load the
important information as much as possible.

All of this is awkward, though; type tags for lists, vector, and maps clearly
fit into the syntax nicely, but getting them onto string literals feels forced.
It also isn't obvious that it serves any purpose outside of doing stuff like
dimensional math, which arguably is better served by just parsing the numeric
strings:

| + 5km 10ft                    <- let the numeric parser handle it

Ok, so type tags apply only when you're using syntax (quotation marks, parens,
etc). I'm not going to complicate literals by having special quasi-infix
operators that behave magically. Moreover, tags serve the narrow purpose of
refining the intent of a value, not some more complicated thing that would
necessitate a data structure. Type tags are not namespaced in any way; a fn()
is always a fn(), and multiple libraries can use this tag in different ways.
