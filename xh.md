code is already stored, we can just wrap it and each defined module into
an appropriate `BEGIN` block.

SSH routing fabric {#chp:ssh-routing-fabric}
==================

xh does all of its distributed communication over SSH stdin/stdout
tunnels (since remote hosts may have port forwarding disabled), which
means that we need to implement a datagram format, routing logic, and a
priority-aware traffic scheduler.

For simplicity, the only session type thatâ€™s supported is RPC. The
request and response each must fit into a single packet, which is
size-limited to 64 kilobytes excluding the packet header. The fabric
client will deal with larger requests and responses, but it will cause
additional round-trips.

Packet format {#sec:packet-format}
-------------

Packets and headers are written in binary, and all multibyte numbers are
big-endian. The structure of a packet is:

    data+header SHA-256:        32 bytes
    packet identity nonce:      32 bytes         \
    source xh instance ID:      4 bytes          |
    destination xh instance ID: 4 bytes          |
    packet creation time:       8 bytes (double) |
    data length:                2 bytes          | SHA applies to these bytes
    message type:               1 byte           |
    priority:                   1 byte           |
    deadline:                   2 bytes          |
    data:                       <= 65535 bytes   /

The only reason we represent packet creation time as a double rather
than as a 64-bit integer is that 64-bit integer support is not
guaranteed within Perl. As a result, we have a somewhat awkward
situation where all absolute times are encoded as doubles and all deltas
as integers.

    use constant header_pack_format        => 'C32 N N d n C C n';
    use constant signed_header_pack_format => 'C32 ' . header_pack_format;

    use constant signed_header_length    => 32 + 32+4+4+8+2+1+1+2;
    use constant header_signature_length => 32;

    our $nonce_state = sha256(time . hostname);
    sub packet_nonce {$nonce_state = sha256(time . $nonce_state)}

    sub encode_packet {
      my ($state, $destination_name, $message_type, $priority, $deadline) = @_;
      die "data is too long: " . length($_[5]) . " (max is 65535 bytes)"
        if length $_[5] >= 65536;

      my $destination_id = $state->{routing_cache}{$destination_name};
      return undef unless defined $destination_id;

      my $header = pack header_pack_format, packet_nonce,
                                            $state->{instance_id},
                                            $destination_id->{endpoint_id},
                                            time,
                                            length $_[5],
                                            $message_type,
                                            $priority,
                                            $deadline;
      my $packet = $header . $_[5];
      sha256($packet) . $packet;
    }

    sub decode_packet_header {
      unpack signed_header_pack_format, $_[0];
    }

    sub signature_is_valid {
      my ($sha) = decode_packet_header $_[0];
      $sha eq sha256(substr $_[0], header_signature_length);
    } 

<span>message type</span> is one of the following values:

1.  Forgetful RPC request. The receiver should execute the code, but the
    sender will not await a reply. This is used internally by xh to
    maintain routing graph information and clock offsets.

2.  Functional RPC request. This indicates that the receiver should
    execute the given code, encoded as text, and send a reply. The code
    may contain references that require further RPCs to be issued.

3.  RPC reply after a successful invocation. The return value of the
    function is encoded in quoted form, and may require further
    dereferencing via RPC.

4.  Callee-side RPC error; the reply is a partially-evaluated quoted
    value, where any unevaluated pieces represent errors.

5.  Routing error or timeout; the routing fabric generates this to
    indicate that it has given up on getting a successful reply. If this
    happens, the sender will automatically re-send the RPC unless the
    deadline has expired.

    use constant {forgetful_rpc  => 0,
                  functional_rpc => 1,
                  rpc_reply      => 2,
                  rpc_error      => 3,
                  routing_error  => 4}; 

<span>priority</span> and <span>deadline</span> are used for scheduling
purposes. Zero is the highest priority, 65535 is the lowest. The
deadline is used to indicate how time-sensitive the packet is; the
queueing order function used by the scheduler is $\frac{2^c}{s}$, where:

$$\begin{aligned}
c & = \frac{\Delta t - d}{16 + p} \\
\Delta t & = \textrm{ms since packet was originally sent} \\
d & = \textrm{the deadline} \\
p & = \textrm{the priority} \\
s & = \textrm{header + data size in bytes}\end{aligned}$$

$\Delta t$ is an estimated quantity, since hosts will not, in general,
have synchronized clocks. However, xh uses a protocol similar to NTP to
estimate clock offsets for each instance. These clock offsets are used
to coordinate instances on different hosts. (See
[sec:clock-offset-estimation].)

    use constant {realtime_priority => 0,
                  high_priority     => 16,
                  normal_priority   => 256,
                  low_priority      => 32768};

    use constant {realtime_deadline          => 0,
                  imperceptible_deadline     => 20,
                  short_interactive_deadline => 50,
                  long_interactive_deadline  => 100,
                  process_blocking_deadline  => 250,
                  background_deadline        => 2000,
                  far_deadline               => 32768}; 

Routing logic {#sec:routing-logic}
-------------

I assume the topology of xh instances will fit into memory. This wonâ€™t
be a problem for most installations; in practice, xh should be able to
easily manage (and transfer data between) many hundreds of machines
without slowing down. Each xh instance maintains a copy of the full
routing graph, which includes information about edge timings.

The routing logicâ€™s job is to decide how to most effectively get packets
from point A to point B, which, more formally, means minimizing the
expected sum of delay costs. Doing this well involves a few factors:

1.  <span>An edgeâ€™s average latency and throughput.</span>

2.  <span>The variance in an edgeâ€™s latency and throughput, absent
    xh</span> traffic.

3.  <span>The impact of traffic on an edgeâ€™s latency and
    throughput.</span>

All of these are continuously measured and periodically propagated as
network topology metadata.
